        "Machine learning uses computer algorithms to create models from input data and uses it to predict on new datasets. There are a few different types of machine learning algorithms like neural networks, classification, regression etc. (Lu et al. 2017). Regression is a specific type of Machine Learning (ML) technique that outputs a numeric value when a number of variables are provided. Some examples of regression algorithms support vector machines (SVM), gradient boosting and random forest.\n",

        "Building a model of solar house price prediction is a complex process. The house price can be determined by its location, size, house type, population, interest rate, tax etc. (Lu et al. 2017). This proposal will detail the usage of ML algorithm to create a model that will predict the price of the property. This product will be a new offering of Domain Group in addition to the existing property portal.\n"

        "Real estate industrial was one of the early adopters of machine learning technologies. A number of researchers have been deducted conducted for price prediction of properties. Xiaoli & Jianguo (2004) outline the disadvantages of artificial neural network model as the precision of the model can be limited. Also, the training time is slow and even more so for models with back propagation. Neural networks are basically a black-box of synapses of neurons. This makes it harder to identify the learning mechanism of the model and to understand what is learnt and what it can forget.\n",
