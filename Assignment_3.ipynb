        "Machine learning uses computer algorithms to create models from input data and uses it to predict on new datasets. There are a few different types of machine learning algorithms like neural networks, classification, regression etc. (Lu et al. 2017). Regression is a specific type of Machine Learning (ML) technique that outputs a numeric value when a number of variables are provided. Some examples of regression algorithms support vector machines (SVM), gradient boosting and random forest.\n",

The house price can be determined by its location, size, house type, population, interest rate, tax etc. (Lu et al. 2017). This proposal will detail the usage of ML algorithm to create a model that will predict the price of the property. This product will be a new offering of Domain Group in addition to the existing property portal.\n"
